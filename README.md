*Hello*

This project is a report based site regarding an outbreak of a "zombie virus" with the purpose of informing people about said virus.

This is how the site should have looked once finished, with a few alterations as time went by.

My main issues with this project were mostly due to images - either having difficulty regarding the size of the image or getting teh position correct on the page.
